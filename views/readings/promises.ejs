          <p class="font-italic">
            If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half way through. 
            We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. 
            We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see 
            how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and selfpity will disappear. We will lose interest in 
            selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life 
            will change. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations 
            which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves. <br>

            Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among usâ€”sometimes quickly, 
            sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.
